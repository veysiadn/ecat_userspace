Note : Static linking is the result of the linker copying all library routines used in the program into the executable image. 
This may require more disk space and memory than dynamic linking, but is both faster and more portable, 
since it does not require the presence of the library on the system where it is run.

Dynamic Linker needs the required library to be on the storage of host computer.
In computing, a dynamic linker is the part of an operating system that loads and links the shared libraries needed by an executable
 when it is executed (at "run time"), by copying the content of libraries from persistent storage to RAM, filling jump tables and relocating pointers.
